# Pepse – 2D Platform Game (Java)
**An Object-Oriented Game Development Project**

Pepse is a 2D side-scrolling game world written in Java. In this game, the player controls a character in a procedurally generated world with terrain, trees that grow fruit, and an energy mechanism (the character’s energy depletes as they move and can be replenished by resting or interacting with the world). This project emphasizes OOP design patterns and game loop mechanics. It was built as part of an OOP course to practice concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and the observer pattern in a fun context.

## How to Run
1. **Install Java JDK:** (Java 11 or above recommended) on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA (the project contains an `src/pepse` package with the game code).
3. **Run the Main Class:**  
   - If using IntelliJ, simply run the provided run configuration or main file.  
   - If using the command line, compile the Java files in `src/pepse` and execute the main class.  
   
   A window will open showing the game world where you can control the character. Use the arrow keys (or as specified in the repo) to move, jump, and explore the environment.

## Media
*A pixel-art character stands on terrain with trees under a blue sky (energy bar at top-left). The world is generated on the fly as the character moves.*

This project was a great exercise in game development – implementing continuous world generation, basic physics (gravity/jumping), and object interactions in Java. It also taught me about structuring a larger project and managing game state over time frames (ticks).
